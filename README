A simple Amazon SimpleDB library for Python 3.

See test.py for example code and usage.

This library was origionally developed for demonstrating the various features of SimpleDB in the book "Beginning SimpleDB". The book project was never completed and the code should *not* necessarily be considered 'production ready'. However, the examples should work as expected and the entire SimpleDB API (Version 2009-04-15) should be supported.

With all that in mind, please feel free to do what you want with this code. :-)

If you have any problems, questions, or comments please feel free to contact me via info@falicon.com any time.
